- Visit and signup/login to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)

- Go to [API page](https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31) and copy your API key

- Create a file with the name `.env` in the root of your project directory and store your API key as follows

  ```js
  VITE_REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY = "Your API key here";
  ```

  ```
  $ npm run dev

## I Used

- [React](http://react.dev/)
- [Material UI](http://mui.com/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Youtube v3 API - RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31)

## I Learned

This was a complicated project at some points. But it led me to solve bugs, improving code and learning new things.

- Even though I have used **Material UI** before, this was a more hands on experience. I could practice a lot of things that are new in MUI v5.
- Experience with **React Router** was also very tough at starting, then it became smooth. Actually, I have used it before, but this was a completely new experience, especially with v6. I could learn a lot of things relate to routing throughtout the development.
- Learned how to use **RapidAPI**. Could learn some advanced usages with axios and working with APIs.
- It was a best decision to switch to **Vite** from create-react-app. I got a special liking to React after using it.
- Learned how to use `.env` file to manage API keys securely.
- Moreover, I learned a lot of best practices, JS concepts, etc. And the complex logical things helped to enhance my programming-level thinking.
